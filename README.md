#Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard

This is a comprehensive sales dashboard of Blinkit, designed in PowerBI. Imported raw data (around 10000 rows of data) from .csv file, performed various data cleaning procedures using Power Query editor and analyzed KPIs, using various charts, according to requirements. Created a field comprising of 4 parameters- total and average sales, no.of items and average ratings.
The visualization uses shades of yellow and green, in sync with Blinkit's brand identity.

KEY INSIGHTS:
•	The data only contained information on grocery and food items. Total and average sales were further filtered by the fat content in foods- sales were greater for low fat products. Advertisements of low-fat foods can be increased for further revenue growth.

•	In terms of outlet size, medium sized outlets dominate over small and big ones.  

•	As you can see, the growth of outlet establishments has mostly been linear, peaking in 2018, gradually being steady thereafter. Blinkit can try to recreate what it did in 2018 to witness fast growth.

•	The top 3 categories of items which contribute the most towards revenues are-
a)	Fresh fruits and veggies
b)	Snacks
c)	c)Daily household items

•	The average feedback rating of fulfilled orders is 4 which isn't bad, but can be improved. In this context, it is to be noted that not all customers give ratings which might result in skewed data.
